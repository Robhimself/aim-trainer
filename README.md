This game used to be a minor task during one of my first weeks studying at Get Academy.
The original instructions were: "to have a view() function that draw 5x5 circles, and one "lamp" will light up and have an onclick function that calls the view() function and renders a new random lamp that lights up, etc etc.
Then try to add a timer that can show the user how much time it took before the right lamp was clicked."

- A basic reaction time-taking game.

I then wanted to add features to it. And converted some of the code to continue practicing concepts I learn on Get Academy.

Hopefully I can add auth and a database, so it can act as a "complete product" for others to try.
